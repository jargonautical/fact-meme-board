# fact-meme-board  

A repo for hacking together the 'Facts don't care about your feelings' dashboard discussed at Open Data Camp 10 in Edinburgh.  

## What's this about?  

We had some discussions in Saturday's sessions about misinformation, and about how we as data people could (or should) tackle it. On Saturday evening I got thinking about something we could build, and pitched the session for Sunday. My idea is something like the Birmingham open data dashboard - not the boring official one, the funny one which I now can't find anywhere. If anyone still has a link or even a picture, please let me know!  

We could reuse the code from the [Open Inovations dashboard] (https://github.com/open-innovations/dashboard), so what we want to do is fill it with facts to counter disinformation.  

## What do we need?  

There's a [Google sheet here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EyoDOS_3Gh_hY_a950MdcO0RxLvMLw78qsFvipuGmE8/edit?gid=0#gid=0) where we started collecting ideas in-session. What we want is ideas and submissions for news items, claims etc that you think can be countered with open data. For each one we need to know:  

* What's the claim? e.g. 'Immigrants are eating swans'
* Who said it?
* What's the true number, or what's the rebuttal?
* What's the source for the rebuttal?
* Is there data about this that we can use, and can you supply the link or tell us where we can find it?

## How do I get involved?  

Other than contributing to the Google sheet, if you want to help us work on this please drop me a message here on Github, on [LinkedIn] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jargonautical), or email me at lucy@jargonautical.com.
