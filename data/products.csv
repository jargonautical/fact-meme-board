2015,,5000,Bins app,https://odileeds.org/products/bin-app/,"Our app on iOS, Android and Windows 10 uses open data to allow people to see their upcoming waste collections.  Users can save their bin dates as calendar reminders, see local recycling sites, and get extra information on waste management. By using an open approach we can make a product at a low cost without needing councils to maintain the app themselves. The app enables local authorities to reach their residents directly and is more cost effective than traditional bin day mail-outs.",img/product_leedsbins.png
